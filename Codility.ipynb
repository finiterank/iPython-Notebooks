      "# Codility Sample Tasks\n",
      "\n",
      "What follows are my solutions to [Codility](https://codility.com) sample tasks. I did lots of both serious and stupid mistakes getting to decent solutions and my first submits were just sad. For the first one I forgot to return $-1$ in the case where there is no equilibrium index. For the second, this one took me the longest, I had forgotten I had to uncount repeated cases and returned the exception case way too early. I also did not know how to run binary searches using Python (at least now I know.) For the third, the easiest of them all, I was using a list instead of a dictionary as a checked bag and thus spending too much time asking if an element had been checked already while iterating over the list.\n",
