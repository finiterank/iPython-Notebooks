      "# Colidity Sample Problems\n",
      "\n",
      "What follows are my solutions to [Colidity](https://codility.com)'s sample problems. I did lots of stupid problems getting to perfect solutions and my first submits were just sad. For the first one I forgot to return $-1$ in the case where there is no equilibrium index. For the second I had forgotten I had to uncount repeated cases and returned the exception way too early. For the third, the easiest of them all, I was using a list instead of a dictionary as a checked bag and thus spending too much time asking if an element had been checked already while iterating over the list.\n",
